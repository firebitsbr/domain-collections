# Documenting your Pull Prequest (PR)

PRs are welcome into this repository for cosmetic issues (i.e. spelling/grammar/formatting) and data/code updates/new contributions.

## All Issues

- Read the Code of Conduct (`CONDUCT.md`) in the root directory of the repository
- Be clear about what you added/changed and why
- [Sign your commits](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-using-gpg/). Please also consider using [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) to make it easier to verify you. **Unsigned PRs will not be accepted.**
- Ensure there is a _descriptive_, _one short sentence_ summary of the change in the PR subject since that will be used (programatticaly) for the `CHANGELOG.md`. See examples in the `CHANGELOG.md` for good summaries

## Cosmetic issues 

Cosmetic fixes are _encouraged_ and _very welcome_. No change/fix is "small". You took the time to come here, saw something amiss and then took even more time to fix it. When you think about it, that's _pretty awesome_. 

Just follow the guidelines for All Issues and you're all set!

## Code/Data Updates or Contributions

Please be specific in the body of the description to help guide PR reviewers. All code updates will be reviewed since these lists may be used for cybersercurity or general internet research purposes and every effort must be made to ensure the integrity of the list and and the safety/efficacy of the any code.

Certain domain lists have copyrights. For example, you _cannot_ include _any_ Amazon Alexa "Top" lists here since they are an Amazon product/service and cannot be shared.

For new resources:

- There _must_ be an accompanying, "approved" Issue that can be tied to the resource.
- No code or data submitted must violate any terms, conditions or technical measures
- Ensure there's a thoughtful, human-centric `README.md` (any format you like)
- Ensure there's a `metadata.json` file (until a schema is defined, see existing files for an example)
- Ensure there's an "updater" file (see existing examples until more info is provided)
